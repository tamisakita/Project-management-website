          <h3>7. Can I use my membership at all locations?</h3>
          <p>
            That depends on which membership package you have, our Bronze
            membership only allows you access to one gym while our Platinum and
            Gold membership packages allow you to go to all of our locations. If
            you have the Bronze package, you can switch locations at the end of
            the month (before your next billing date) if you choose to do so.
            Contact us for more details.

          <p>
            Many of our workout classes are very popular and fill up fast so
            it’s best to book classes in advance. We do offer classes from time
            to time where drop ins are allowed, based on space available. You
            can book classes on our website, our app, or by talking to someone
            at the front desk at each of our locations.
